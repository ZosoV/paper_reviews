# Deep Learning Reading Group

Tired of not knowing what to do for your final project, join the group to be even more uncertain about your thesis topic.

We intend to read at least two papers per month, and hopefully, we will figure out our master projects.

## Dynamic
The dynamic is simple: every two weeks (more or less), two people from the group present two papers (one each one) they have been reading and try to explain it to the rest of us. In the meantime, others can ask questions and encourage a discussion.
